This project was created during early phase of my JS journey and
nowadays I use different approach to structures, styling and overall JS functionality]** <br><br>


I practiced creating buttons in JavaScript from random items and printing their names when the user clicks them. While working on this, I started thinking about making a game ‚Äî and got the idea from random, famous animated video. 

#### Through this project, I learned:

-How to dynamically create buttons with JavaScript
-How to add content like images and sounds inside if/else statements
-More about built-in JavaScript methods
-Basic logic flow to make the game work by clicking buttons in the correct order

I used a few tools to help me along the way:
YouTube, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot.

Here is the link to play the game: <br>
