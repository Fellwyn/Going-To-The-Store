Going to the store 


I had to practice creating buttons in JS from random items and printing
the names when user clicks them. I started to think about a game and also
one random famous video came into my mind. So here it is, Going to the store game!

I learned more about creating buttons in JS, adding more content on if/else 
statements like pictures and sounds and more about build in methods.
The game works if user presses the right buttons in right order.


I used a few sites, YouTube, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot on this project.

Here is the link to play the game:
